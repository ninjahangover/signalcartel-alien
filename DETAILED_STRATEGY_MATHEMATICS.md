## **MATHEMATICAL BREAKDOWN OF EACH STRATEGY COMPONENT**

### **1. GPU NEURAL STRATEGY - Deep Learning Pattern Recognition**

#### **Component: Deep Learning Pattern Recognition**
```

Where:
φ_k(x_t) = Activation function for pattern k at time t
w_k = Learned weight for pattern k from backpropagation
n = Number of recognized patterns (typically 50-200)

Mathematical Implementation:
φ_k(x_t) = max(0, Σ_{i} w_{k,i} × price_feature_i + b_k)  // ReLU activation
```

#### **Component: Neural Network Optimization**
```
Network Output = σ(W_output × H_final + b_output)

Where:
H_final = Final hidden layer = φ(W_3 × φ(W_2 × φ(W_1 × X + b_1) + b_2) + b_3)
σ(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z))  // Sigmoid activation for final output
W_i = Weight matrices learned through gradient descent
X = Input feature vector [price, volume, RSI, MACD, ...]

Gradient Update:
∂L/∂W = (1/m) × Σ_{i=1}^m ∂L_i/∂W
W_new = W_old - α × ∂L/∂W  where α = learning rate
```

#### **Component: Model Accuracy Calculation**
```

Where:
TP = True Positives (correct BUY predictions)
TN = True Negatives (correct SELL predictions)  
FP = False Positives (wrong BUY predictions)
FN = False Negatives (wrong SELL predictions)

Confidence Weighting:
final_confidence = raw_neural_output × model_accuracy × pattern_strength

pattern_strength = max(φ_k(x_t)) / Σ_k φ_k(x_t)  // Strongest pattern dominance
```

...

Mathematical Proof of Multi-Dimensionality:
||confidence_vector||₂ = √(c₁² + c₂² + ... + c_D²)
normalized_confidence = ||confidence_vector||₂ / √D  // Normalize to [0,1]
```

#### **Component: Risk-Adjusted Expectancy**
```
risk_adjusted_expectancy = (P_win × Avg_Win - P_loss × Avg_Loss) / Risk_per_Trade

Where:
P_win = Probability of winning trade = Σ_{i ∈ wins} confidence_i / N_total
P_loss = Probability of losing trade = 1 - P_win
Avg_Win = E[profit | trade wins] = Σ_{winning_trades} profit_i / N_wins  
Avg_Loss = E[loss | trade loses] = Σ_{losing_trades} |loss_i| / N_losses
Risk_per_Trade = max(stop_loss, volatility × 2σ)

Mathematical Derivation:
E[PnL] = P_win × Avg_Win + P_loss × (-Avg_Loss)
Sharpe_ratio = E[PnL] / √(Var[PnL])
risk_adjusted_expectancy = E[PnL] / Risk_per_Trade × Sharpe_ratio
```

tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/(e^x + e^(-x))  // Bounded to [-1,1]
```

#### **Component: Anti-Fragility Score**
```
anti_fragility = Σ_{v ∈ volatility_events} profit_during_volatility / volatility_magnitude

Where:
volatility_events = {t : σ_t > μ_σ + 2×std(σ)}  // High volatility periods
profit_during_volatility = PnL earned during high volatility
volatility_magnitude = σ_t / μ_σ  // Normalized volatility

Mathematical Proof:
Anti-fragile system: ∂profit/∂volatility > 0
anti_fragility_score = (1/N) × Σ_{i=1}^N (profit_i × volatility_i) / Σ volatility_i²

Where:
state_transition_frequency = N_transitions / total_time_periods
instability_penalty = Σ|P_ii - diagonal_dominance_threshold|

Mathematical Proof:
Stable Markov Chain: P_ii > 0.5 for all states i (diagonal dominance)
state_persistence = min(P_ii) across all states
stability_score = state_persistence × (1 - transition_entropy)

transition_entropy = -Σ_i Σ_j P_ij × log(P_ij)  // Shannon entropy of transitions
```

regime_persistence = avg(time_spent_in_each_state) / total_time

Mathematical Validation:
regime_accuracy = (N_correct_predictions / N_total_predictions)

Expected Profit Calculation:
expected_profit = position_size × expected_move × (1 - commission_rate)
expected_risk = position_size × max(stop_loss, 2×volatility)

Mathematical Risk-Return:
profit_probability = P(expected_profit > commission_cost + minimum_profit)
Using historical distribution of profits:
P(profit > threshold) = 1 - CDF(threshold | profit_distribution)
```

#### **Component: Risk-Adjusted Return**
```
risk_adjusted_return = (expected_return - risk_free_rate) / volatility

Where:
expected_return = E[position_pnl] = Σ P_i × return_i
risk_free_rate = current_treasury_rate / 252  // Daily risk-free rate  
volatility = √(Σ P_i × (return_i - expected_return)²)

Sharpe Ratio Modification:
sharpe_ratio = (expected_return - risk_free_rate) / volatility
risk_adjusted_return = sharpe_ratio × √(252) × confidence_factor

confidence_factor = min(1.0, total_ai_confidence / confidence_threshold)
```

#### **Component: Historical Accuracy Tracking**
