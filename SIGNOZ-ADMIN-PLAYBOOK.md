## üîß Daily Operations

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)
1. **Check overnight performance:**
   ```bash
   # Quick system health check
   curl -s http://localhost:3301/api/v1/health
   ```

2. **Review key metrics:**
   - Total trades last 24h
   - Average win rate
   - System errors/alerts
   - Database performance

3. **Verify all services healthy:**
   ```bash
   docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}" | grep -E "(signoz|quantum-forge)"
   ```

### Weekly Review (15 minutes)
1. **Performance trends analysis**
2. **Alert fine-tuning** (reduce false positives)
3. **Dashboard optimization** based on usage patterns
4. **Backup monitoring data** (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "SigNoz dashboard won't load"
**Symptoms:** Browser shows connection error at localhost:3301
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker ps | grep signoz-frontend

# Restart if needed  
cd /opt/signoz && sudo docker-compose restart frontend
```

### Problem: "No telemetry data showing"
**Symptoms:** Dashboard shows no traces or metrics
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify SignalCartel is sending data
export OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug
./scripts/monitoring/start-with-signoz.sh

# Check for telemetry errors in logs
tail -f /tmp/signalcartel-logs/production-trading.log | grep -i "otel\|telemetry"
```

### Problem: "Too many alerts firing"
**Symptoms:** Alert fatigue from false positives
**Solution:**
- Increase alert thresholds by 20-30%
- Add longer time windows (5 min ‚Üí 10 min)
- Use composite conditions (memory + CPU together)

### Problem: "Dashboard is slow"
**Symptoms:** SigNoz interface taking >5 seconds to load
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check ClickHouse database performance
docker exec -it signoz-clickhouse clickhouse-client --query "SELECT count() FROM signoz_traces.distributed_signoz_index_v2"

# Restart services if needed
cd /opt/signoz && sudo docker-compose restart
```

## üìà Advanced Configuration

### Custom Business Metrics
Add these to your SignalCartel applications:

```javascript
// In your trading engine files
const { metrics } = require('./scripts/monitoring/signoz-integration.js');

// Track custom business metrics
metrics.tradesPerHour.add(1, { strategy: 'quantum-oscillator' });
metrics.winRate.record(0.73, { timeframe: '1h' });  
metrics.aiResponseTime.record(245, { system: 'sentiment' });
```

### Database Performance Tracking
```javascript
// Add to database query wrappers
const startTime = Date.now();
// ... your database query ...
const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
metrics.databaseLatency.record(duration, { 
  query_type: 'trading_signal_insert',
  database: 'primary' 
});
```
