```bash
# Reset to Phase 0 with clean $10K balance
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://warehouse_user:quantum_forge_warehouse_2024@localhost:5433/signalcartel?schema=public" \
npx tsx admin/simple-system-reset.ts
```

#### **STEP 5: Deployment Validation**
```bash
# Start system with full monitoring
./admin/start-quantum-forge-with-monitor.sh

# Monitor logs in separate terminal
tail -f /tmp/signalcartel-logs/production-trading.log

# Verify GPU acceleration is working (should see 0-1ms processing times)
# Verify no "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
# Watch for successful position processing without stalls
```

#### **STEP 6: Post-Deployment Monitoring Checklist**
- [ ] System processes positions without stalling (monitor for 30+ minutes)

- [ ] Exit system processing positions every 5 seconds

#### **STEP 7: Stall Prevention Monitoring Setup**
```bash
# Create monitoring script for automated stall detection
# Set up log monitoring for activity gaps >3 minutes
# Implement auto-restart if system becomes unresponsive
# Document manual recovery: pkill -f "npx tsx" + restart sequence
```

**üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA**: System runs >2 hours without stalls, processes 50+ positions successfully, maintains GPU acceleration, and completes full trading cycles.
