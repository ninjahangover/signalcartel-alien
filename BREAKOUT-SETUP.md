## üìà Strategy for Success

### Conservative Approach (Recommended)
- Focus on BTCUSD/ETHUSD with 5x leverage
- $50-100 positions (before leverage)
- 2% stop loss, 3% take profit
- Target 2-3 trades per day
- Need only 10 winning trades to pass

### Mathematical Edge
- Your 76% win rate = strong probability
- 10 trades at 3% profit = $150 per win
- 4 trades at 2% loss = $20 per loss
- Net: ~$110 profit per 10 trades
- Need 5 cycles (50 trades) to reach $500 target

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

```bash
# Start Breakout evaluation system
cd /home/telgkb9/depot/signalcartel-breakout
./breakout-start.sh

# Monitor dashboard
# Open browser: http://localhost:3005

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/breakout-logs/monitor.log

# Stop system
./breakout-stop.sh
```

## üéØ Path to $500 Profit

**Week 1**:
- Trade BTCUSD/ETHUSD only
- 2-3 trades daily
- Target: $100-150 profit

**Week 2**:
- Add SOLUSD/AVAXUSD if performing well
- Maintain discipline
- Target: $200 cumulative

**Week 3-4**:
- Conservative continuation
- Reach $500 target
- Minimum 5 trading days achieved

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER exceed $200 daily loss** (equity-based)
2. **NEVER exceed $300 total drawdown** (equity-based)
3. **Close positions before 00:25 UTC** to avoid financing fees
4. **Monitor floating P&L** - it counts toward limits
5. **Use the dashboard** - visual monitoring prevents breaches

## üèÜ Why This Will Work

- **Proven System**: 76% win rate in production
- **Conservative Sizing**: Only risking 1% per trade
- **Parallel Operation**: No interference with main system
- **Real Monitoring**: Drawdown calculator prevents breaches
- **Mathematical Edge**: Need only 10% return with high win rate
