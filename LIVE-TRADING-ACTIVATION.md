# 🚀 QUANTUM FORGE™ LIVE TRADING ACTIVATION GUIDE

## 🎯 READY TO DEPLOY: Your $407.60 → Real Trading

### ⚡ STEP 1: VALIDATE KRAKEN INTEGRATION (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test Kraken API with validation (no real trades)
npx tsx admin/test-kraken-validation.ts

### 🔥 STEP 2: ENABLE LIVE EXECUTION (2 minutes)

```typescript
// Change from:
validate: true // Set to false for actual execution, true for validation testing

// Change to:
validate: false // LIVE TRADING ENABLED - REAL TRADES WILL EXECUTE
```

### 🚨 STEP 3: FINAL SAFETY CHECK (3 minutes)

```bash
# Check your account balance and configuration
npx tsx admin/live-trading-control.ts status

```
