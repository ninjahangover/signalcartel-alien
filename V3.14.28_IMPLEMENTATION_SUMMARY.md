private readonly REGIME_CHECK_INTERVAL = 300000; // 5 minutes
```

**Lines 2107-2113**: Trading Cycle Integration
```typescript
// 🚀 V3.14.28: DETECT MARKET REGIME (every 5 minutes)
await this.detectAndUpdateMarketRegime();

// 🚀 V3.14.28: EMERGENCY ROTATION (check every cycle)

```

**Lines 2205-2209**: Pair Filtering Integration
```typescript
// 🚀 V3.14.28: Check regime-aware blacklist FIRST
if (this.isSymbolBlacklistedInRegime(data.symbol)) {
  log(`🚫 V3.14.28 REGIME BLACKLIST: ${data.symbol}...`);
  continue;
}
```

**Lines 5067-5267**: Helper Methods (200 lines)
- `detectAndUpdateMarketRegime()` - Regime detection
- `isSymbolBlacklistedInRegime()` - Blacklist check
- `addToRegimeBlacklist()` - Blacklist management
- `evaluateAndExecuteEmergencyRotation()` - Emergency rotation
- `forceClosePosition()` - Position closing

## 📈 WHAT TO EXPECT (Next 24-48 Hours)

### Immediate (First Hour):
- ✅ System loads without errors
- ✅ No V3.14.28 errors in logs
- ⏳ Regime detection logs appear within 5-30 minutes
- ⏳ Emergency rotation evaluates if capital locked >90%

### Short Term (6-12 Hours):
- ⏳ Regime detection stabilizes (should see consistent regime type)
- ⏳ If capital still locked >90%, emergency rotation should trigger
- ⏳ Blacklisted symbols (BTC/ETH/SOL) may become tradeable again
- ⏳ Available capital should increase (from $3.38 → $50+)

### Medium Term (24-48 Hours):
- ⏳ 10-20 closed positions (vs 0 in last 7 days)
- ⏳ Capital utilization 60-80% (vs 98.6%)
- ⏳ Average hold time 15-45 minutes (vs 6+ hours)
- ⏳ P&L stable or improving (-$5 to +$10 range)

## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS FROM IMPLEMENTATION

### Technical Learnings:
1. **Regime Context Matters**: Win rate in BEAR ≠ win rate in BULL
2. **Capital Velocity > Win Rate**: Flat 6h position worse than quick -0.5% loss
3. **Proactive > Reactive**: Detect capital lockup before it paralyzes system
4. **BTC is Market Leader**: Use BTC price action to infer broader market regime

### Architecture Learnings:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: 3 separate modules (regime, blacklist, rotation) compose well
2. **Throttling Critical**: Regime check every 5min (not every cycle) prevents noise
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: Need 60%+ confidence for regime change to reset blacklist
4. **Multiple Urgency Levels**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW allows nuanced responses

### Philosophy Learnings:
1. **Adaptation > Optimization**: Perfect strategy for BEAR fails in BULL
2. **Context-Aware Systems**: Historical data needs regime context to be useful
3. **Deadlock Detection**: System can't trade if paralyzed by own logic
4. **Emergency Overrides**: Sometimes need to force action when stuck

---

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Price History Dependency**: Needs 20+ BTC candles for regime detection (20-30min warmup)
2. **Simplified OHLC Data**: Using close prices to approximate OHLC (good enough for regime)
3. **No Partial Close Yet**: Emergency rotation does full close (partial close = TODO)
4. **Regime Transitions**: May have false positives during transitional markets
5. **V3.14.24 Bug Still Present**: `countHighQualityOpportunities()` may not be working

---

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS (If Issues Arise)

### If Regime Detection Not Working:
1. Check BTC price history accumulation: `priceHistoryCache.get('BTCUSD')`
2. Lower `REGIME_CHECK_INTERVAL` to 1 minute for faster iteration
3. Add debug logging to `detectAndUpdateMarketRegime()`

### If Blacklist Not Resetting:
1. Verify regime confidence >60% during changes
2. Check `hasRegimeChanged()` logic
3. Manually call `this.regimeBlacklist.clearAll()` to force reset

### If Emergency Rotation Not Triggering:
1. Verify `countHighQualityOpportunities()` is returning >0
2. Lower `CRITICAL_CAPITAL_UTILIZATION` to 85% (from 95%)
3. Check position P&L calculations are correct

### If System Crashes:
1. Check logs: `tail -100 /tmp/signalcartel-logs/production-trading.log`
2. Verify TypeScript types (may have null reference errors)
3. Restart with `./tensor-stop.sh && ./tensor-start.sh`

- [ ] 10+ closed positions (vs 0 in last week)
- [ ] Capital utilization <85% (vs 98.6%)
- [ ] Average hold time <60 minutes (vs 6+ hours)
- [ ] System trading BTC/ETH/SOL again (if regime changed)
- [ ] Total P&L between -$5 and +$10 (capital preservation maintained)
