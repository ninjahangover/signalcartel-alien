## 🔍 PRE-CONTEST VERIFICATION

### Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Ensure ByBit API credentials are set
BYBIT_API_KEY=hZ8yoA7i... ✅
BYBIT_API_SECRET=rCjKY7UgLe... ✅

# 2. CFT account configuration
CFT_ACCOUNT_SIZE=10000 ✅
CFT_DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT=500 ✅
CFT_MAX_LOSS_LIMIT=1200 ✅
```

### System Startup Verification
```bash
# Test system startup
npx tsx cft-production-trading-enhanced.ts

# Expected output:
✅ All AI systems initialized
✅ ByBit API connections established
✅ Dynamic leverage system ready
✅ CFT compliance monitoring active
✅ Risk orchestrator operational
```

### Dynamic Leverage Test
```bash
# Test leverage calculation
npx tsx test-dynamic-leverage.ts

# Expected output:
🔧 CALCULATED LEVERAGE: 1-5x range ✅
📊 Mathematical reasoning provided ✅
💰 Position sizing with leverage ✅
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS & LIMITATIONS

### API Access Requirements
- **IP Whitelisting**: CFT API requires IP whitelisting for live trading
- **Public API Fallback**: System gracefully uses public API for market data
- **Rate Limits**: ByBit API rate limits respected

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)
- TensorFlow.js GPU acceleration disabled (CPU fallback working)
- Some AI engine method calls need adjustment (fallbacks working)
- Mathematical engine integrations use default values when unavailable

### Risk Management Safeguards
- Maximum 2% risk per trade regardless of leverage
- Position size auto-adjustment for leverage compliance
- Emergency stop mechanisms active
- CFT compliance checks on every trade

## 🎯 CONTEST STRATEGY

### Phase 1 Goals
- **Target**: $800 profit (8% of $10K account)
- **Risk**: Maximum $500 daily loss, $1,200 total loss
- **Approach**: Conservative-aggressive with dynamic leverage
- **Timeline**: Minimum 5 trading days

### Leverage Strategy
- **High Confidence (>80%)**: 3-5x leverage
- **Moderate Confidence (60-80%)**: 2-3x leverage
- **Low Confidence (<60%)**: 1-2x leverage
- **Risk-adjusted**: Position size scales with leverage

### AI Integration
- Multiple AI models vote on trade opportunities
- Regime-aware risk adjustments
- Mathematical pattern recognition
- Bayesian probability weighting
