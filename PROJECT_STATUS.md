## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Persistence Solution
- **Method**: Browser's global `window.__STRATUS_ENGINE_STATE__`
- **Benefit**: Survives all React component unmounts
- **Location**: `/src/lib/persistent-engine-manager.ts`

### Trading Flow
```
Pine Script Signal
    ↓
Webhook Received
    ↓
Platform Router
    ├─→ Paper: Alpaca API
    └─→ Live: Kraken Webhook
```

### Strategy Optimization Cycle
```
7-Day Market Data → AI Analysis → Parameter Adjustment → Trade Execution → Performance Feedback
                ↑                                                                    ↓
                └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Current Stats (Sample)
- **Active Strategies**: 3
- **Average Win Rate**: 78.4%
- **Optimization Frequency**: Every 15 minutes
- **Market Data Window**: 7 days rolling
- **Data Points Analyzed**: Continuous

## 🧪 Testing Phase

### Current Phase: Multi-Week Validation
**Start Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Duration**: 2-4 weeks  
**Purpose**: Validate AI/ML improvements  

### Testing Objectives
1. Measure win rate improvements over time
2. Validate strategy optimization effectiveness
3. Collect performance data for analysis
4. Test system stability and persistence
5. Verify automated execution reliability

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Win rate improvement trend
- [ ] Stable 24/7 operation
- [ ] Successful paper trade execution
- [ ] Consistent optimization cycles
- [ ] No manual intervention required

## 🛠️ Maintenance Notes

### Daily Checks
- Engine status (should always be "Active")
- Strategy performance metrics
- Paper trading execution logs
- Optimization history

### Weekly Reviews
- Win rate trends
- Strategy parameter evolution
- Market condition adaptations
- System resource usage

---

## 📝 Known Behaviors

### Expected Console Messages
- "Stratus Engine already running (persistent state)" - Normal
- "Input optimizer history not available" - Handled with fallbacks
- Service import errors - Intentionally handled

### UI Indicators
- Green dot = Engine Active
- Strategy count may start at 0 and populate
- Events/Optimizations accumulate over time

---

## 🚫 Critical Warnings

### DO NOT MODIFY
1. `persistent-engine-manager.ts` - Core persistence logic
2. Webhook routing configuration
3. Alpaca payload validation
4. Global window state management

### DO NOT ADD
1. Manual trading forms
2. Pine Script alert code generation
3. Test connection buttons
4. Manual strategy execution

---

## 📞 Support & Documentation

### Key Documentation Files
- `/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - Development history and changes
- `/ALPACA_PAYLOAD_VALIDATION.md` - Alpaca integration details
- `/test-alpaca-payload-validation.js` - Validation test suite

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why Window State?** - Survives React lifecycle
- **Why No Manual Trading?** - Full automation is the goal
- **Why 7-Day Analysis?** - Optimal balance of data and relevance
- **Why 15-Min Optimization?** - Responsive without overreacting

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing Phase)
1. Monitor daily performance
2. Track win rate improvements
3. Document any anomalies
4. Collect optimization patterns

### Future Enhancements (Post-Testing)
1. Advanced ML models
2. Multi-exchange support
3. Risk management refinements
4. Strategy backtesting suite
